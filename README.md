# astrochemcd

This is a python package to evaluate molecular column density for the integrated intensity maps of line emission observations.
It is not meant to apply rotational diagram analysis: just to extract disk averaged or radial profile of column density, knowing line parameters, flux, excitation temperature.
Assumption: optically thin emission.
